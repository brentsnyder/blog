      <h2> Hey! I'm Brent.</h2>
      <p> I started this site because I am interested in teaching and sharing content that helps you become a better data scientist. 
      </p> 
      <p>I have a day job as a Sr. Manager, Business Analytics at Walmart where I solve merchant's needs with insights and analytics. I've been in the analytics game a while and received a MS in Analytics from Georgia Tech and a BS Economics from the University of Arkansas.
      </p>
      <p>Python is my go-to programming language but don't be surprised if you see me using the Tidyverse in #rstats or visualizations in PowerBI or Tableau. Visit my social media channels and let me know what I can do to help you on your journey.
